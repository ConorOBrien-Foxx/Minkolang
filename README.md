# Minkolang
The Minkowskian (2+1)D semi-golfing language!

This language was inspired by [Befunge](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) and [><>](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Fish), both of which are 2D programming languages. It is a (2+1)D Minkowskian language, meaning that it has two dimensions of space and one dimension of time. When the instruction pointer is not moving through space, it is moving through time (the layers of the program). The program space is toroidal in all directions, meaning that if the instruction pointer moves outside of the program's boundary in spacetime, then it will relocate to the opposite side.
